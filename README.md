# Showtopia
A collection of concerts, a travelogue for live shows. Users can upload shows and "like" or "attend" other shows.

Until the app is officially deployed, please run ```npm start``` on port 2001.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Like any social media app, users can create content and interact with existing content.

## Optimizations

Users will soon have the ability to edit concert information such as setlists. Also planning a comment feature for users to describe their experiences at each show.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me better understand how to interact with databases.

## Examples:
Take a look at these examples that I have in my own portfolio:
